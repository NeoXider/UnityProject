﻿# Version History:

## 5.6.1: Maintenance - Update
Features:
- [Feature-2025-6] Added support for the Unity IAP (In-App Purchases) package [thanks Alain].

Bug Fixes:
- [Bug-2025-6] Fixed an issue where Unity Events declared as private in base classes were not detected correctly. This caused some Unity Events to be mistakenly obfuscated, preventing UI events from being triggered as expected [thanks Greg].
- [Bug-2025-5] Resolved an issue where Burst Compiler code inside nested classes was not properly detected. This led to unintended managed code calls, which are not permitted from unmanaged code [thanks Steve].
- [Bug-2025-4] Fixed a problem with the 'Package' obfuscation setting failing to work correctly with new render pipelines (URP/HDRP) [thanks Gleb].

## 5.6.0: Big Assets - Update
Features:
- [Feature-2025-5] Added settings to customize obfuscation of delegates [thanks David].
- [Feature-2025-4] The 'Add random code' security component now has a setting that can be used to force the generation of random codes for classes where this would otherwise be skipped.
- [Feature-2025-3] Support of PixelCrushers assets (Dialogue System & Quest Machine) [thanks Marcus].

Bug Fixes:
- [Bug-2025-3] Patching assets or resources exceeding 2 GB triggered an overflow exception [thanks Joon].
- [Bug-2025-2] Unity events in base classes were not found correctly.

## 5.5.0: Enums & Structs - Update
Features:
- [Feature-2025-2] Obfuscation of enum and struct class fields can now be customized to meet specific needs. The field settings have been extended to include dedicated settings for fields in enums and structs.
- [Feature-2025-1] Obfuscation of enum and struct classes can now be customized to meet specific needs. The class settings have been extended to include dedicated settings for enums and structs.

Improvements:
- [Imprv-2025-1] The Obfuscate Anyway attribute now includes support for structs. Additionally, it allows for random obfuscation names when the passed name field is left empty or null.

Bug Fixes:
- [Bug-2025-1] Fixed an issue where internal classes were only obfuscated when obfuscation of private classes was enabled, but not when obfuscation of internal classes was enabled. This has been corrected and internal classes are now obfuscated correctly. Notably, nested internal classes were correctly recognized and handled during this process.

## 5.4.1: Internal - Update
- Improvement: Some internal optimizations to make the Obuscator more robust.

## 5.4.0: Mapping - Update
- Feature: The obfuscation mapping can now be loaded from a web endpoint (Get) and saved at a web endpoint (Post).
- Improvement: If an obfuscation mapping could not be saved in the location specified by the user, it is saved in the obfuscator temp directory 'Assets\OPS\Obfuscator\Temp' [thanks David].

## 5.3.2: data.unity3d - Hotfix 2
- Fix: Error while obfuscating data.unity3d file '.../data.unity3d': Value cannot be null. Parameter name: _Assembly [thanks David].
- Compatibility: Most compatibility components can now be manually activated or deactivated. Default is activated.

## 5.3.1: data.unity3d - Hotfix
- Fix: Error while obfuscating data.unity3d file : Unable to read beyond the end of the stream [thanks Josh].

## 5.3.0: iOS - Update
- Improvement: Unity animation compatibility - You can now customize where animation callbacks should be automatically searched (models, animation clips, animator controllers).
- Improvement: Unity event compatibility - You can now customize where event callbacks should be automatically searched (scenes, prefabs).
- Fix: iOS build - MonoBehaviours were not obfuscated correctly in Unity 2022+ iOS builds. Resulting in MonoBehaviours failed to be resolved while runtime.

## 5.2.0: Addressable - Update
As this is a major update, it is recommended to remove the current OPS directory, make a backup copy of the Obfuscator settings file and download the new version.
- Feature: Lz4 / Lz4HC - The Obfuscator now supports obfuscation of builds that use compression with Lz4 and Lz4HC. This does not affect your workflow, but only improves the obfuscation of MonoBehaviours, which previously required a workaround.
- Feature: Addressables - A popular Unity asset to address assets from different locations. Obfuscator now supports obfuscation of addressable bundles using the JSON catalog. To activate obfuscation of Addressables activate it under the 'Compatibility' tab [thanks Dmitriy].
- Improvement: Memory usage - Obfuscator estimates the compatibility of assets for obfuscation. This included model or texture files. These were not disposed of correctly after loading, leading to potential memory issues.
- Fix: XCode - Obfuscator failed when creating XCode projects. This has been fixed [thanks Misha].

## 5.1.7: Burst - Update
- Fix: Obfuscated strings compiled by 'Burst' throw an exception that they cannot call managed code in a native environment. Therefore, strings in 'BurstCompile' jobs are now skipped from obfuscation. They are automatically safe due to their native environment [thanks Curtis].
- Fix: There was a rare case in which a type could not be resolved correctly. This caused an exception when building the Unity project. This is now fixed and even if a type still cannot be resolved, a warning is now displayed and the type is skipped from the obfuscation [thanks Cameron].

## 5.1.6: MongoDB Realm - Update
- Compatibility: Made the Obfuscator compatible with 'MongoDB Realm' [thanks Hector].
  -> Classed that inherite from Realms.IAsymmetricObject, Realms.IEmbeddedObject, Realms.IRealmObject and read/store data in the storage can be skipped from obfuscation to preserve the data integrity.
- Improvement: The random code generation no longer will create random code in classes that are skipped from obfuscation. This often lead to unexpected problems, as these classes were skipped by the user for a specific reason.

## 5.1.5:
- Fix: When disabling obfuscating for serializeable classes, serializeable fields still got obfuscated [thanks Eric].
- Compatibility: Fixed a compatibility issue with Zenject [thanks Dmitriy].

## 5.1.4:
- Fix: The obfuscation pipline did not check correctly for a development build. So "NotObfuscatedCauseAttribute" were not added to development builds.
- Fix: When obfuscating "older" .Net-Framework assemblies that had native pdb symbols, those symbols could not be rewritten, causing a failed build. The new default for these are portable pdf symbols (which makes even more sense for unity).
- Compatibility: Fixed a compatibility issue with StateMachineBehaviours when obfuscating ScriptableObjects.

## 5.1.3:
- Compatibility: .NetStandard - Obfuscator 2021 and 2022 now use .NetStandard 2.0 and 2023 and onwards use .NetStandard 2.1.
- QoL: The log writer now checks for invalid file locations.

## 5.1.2:
- Fix: Bee compiler could not resolve 'OPS.Obfuscator.Editor'.

## 5.1.1:
- Fix: Compatibility with Unity 2023.1 and onwards by switching the obfuscator build to .NetStandard 2.1.
- Add: Support of Meta SDKs - Facebook and Oculus
- Add: Support of Microsoft Playfab.

## 5.1.0:
- Add: OnRectTransformDimensionsChange will now be skipped from obfuscation for MonoBehaviours.
- Update: The UI / GUI compatibility addon was changed to an Unity-Event addon. Mostly UI / GUI or similiar methods are based on UnityEvent.
  When activated (by default it is activated), all methods attached to these events will be skipped.

## 5.0.5:
- Fix: Compatibility fix for the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

## 5.0.4:
- Fix: Json serialization for public fields - Class requires Serializable Attribute.
- Fix: Dependency fix at release build.

## 5.0.3:
- Fix: OPS.Obfuscator.dll assembly was loaded as to obfuscate assembly. Is now a helper assembly.

## 5.0.2:
- Fix: Reference bug to OPS.Obfuscator.dll.

## 5.0.1:
- Improved Gui/Animation method recognition.
- Obfuscator UI improvement.
- OPS.Obfuscator.dll is now an AssemblyDefinitionFile.
- Fix: Removed OPS.Obfuscator.dll from release builds.

## 5.0

== Obfuscator 5.0 Introduction ==
The Obfuscator 5.0 version optimizes the MonoBehaviour protection and brings the obfuscation through
new features on a new level. By introducing ControlFlow Obfuscation, method bodies will be scrambled
and transformed into a nearly human unreadable form. An also new feature is the AntiTampering Obfuscation.
This feature builds a system of micro-checks to prevent modification and keeps hacker away.

----------------------------------------

4.0.6:
- Fix: Building Addressable Assets will no longer trigger the obfuscator and a so failed build.
- Add: You can now enter a custom log directory, instead of a file path only. In this directory, the log will be seperated by platform.

- Fix: ArgumentException: ... Type .. has no scope?

4.0.4:
- Fix: On Analyse Scenes / Components - MissingMethodException.
- Fix: Enum wont be obfuscated if 'Obfuscate Serializable Classes' is deactivated.

4.0.3
- Fix: While processing pre build pipeline: System.MissingMethodException

4.0.2
- Fix: InvalidCastException while analysing assemblies.
- Fix: Yaml failed deserialization while analysing assets.

4.0.1
- Add: EventTrigger inspector method will now be recognized too.

4.0

== Obfuscator 4.0 Introduction ==

The Obfuscator 4.0 version is a bottom up new implemented Obfuscator, to increase the performance, security and
compatibility to Unity 2018+ versions. For you the process keeps the same. The Obfuscator still automatically applies
the obfuscation at build time. The Setting and Error-Stack-Track windows got a face lifting to be more intuitive and easier
to use. The settings and rename-mapping are now stored in a Json serialized file. This means for you,
because of the modification and the extension of the settings, you have to readjust the settings in the settings window.
It is not necessary to change the rename-mapping files. They will still be normally interpreted. But new rename-mappings
will be stored in the new Json format.

Most important obfuscation changes:
- You have more options to decide which assemblies you want to obfuscate.
- The string obfuscation is now way more advanced. (Pro only)
- The obfuscation of MonoBehaviour/ScriptableObject/Playable subclasses is way more advanced too. (Pro only)
- Also inspector set values / methods are now even better recognized.
